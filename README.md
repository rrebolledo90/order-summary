## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Figma

### What I learned

This was a fun project, things I learned included how to set a hover state to a button,
how to set background images relative to the body, and shadowing. Everything was done with Flexbox,
I am starting to get a better hang of layouts.

### Continued development

Need to work more on understanding relative units better, such as vh, em, rem, etc. and when to use one over the other.
